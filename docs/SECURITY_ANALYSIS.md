# QNet Security Analysis: Burn-to-Join + Commit-Reveal

## Executive Summary

QNet combines **burn-to-join** economics with **Commit-Reveal** consensus, creating a unique security model. This analysis evaluates the robustness of this combination.

## 1. Economic Security Analysis

### 1.1 Attack Cost Calculation

```
Phase 1 (Solana):
- Node cost: 1,000 â†’ 100 QNA (dynamic pricing)
- Attack requirement: 51% of nodes
- If 1,000 nodes active: Need 510 nodes
- Minimum attack cost: 51,000 QNA (at best price)
- Maximum attack cost: 510,000 QNA (at worst price)

Phase 2 (QNet Mainnet):
- Same burn mechanism but on native chain
- Additional gas costs for operations
```

### 1.2 Burn vs Stake Comparison

| Attack Vector | Proof-of-Stake | Burn-to-Join |
|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| Nothing at Stake | Possible - can stake on multiple chains | **Impossible** - tokens are burned |
| Long Range Attack | Possible - can buy old keys | **Very Hard** - need historical burns |
| Bribery Attack | Moderate - can promise returns | **Expensive** - must compensate burns |
| Sybil Attack | Linear cost | **Linear cost** but permanent |
| Recovery after attack | Can unstake and exit | **No recovery** - permanent loss |

**Verdict**: Burn-to-join provides **stronger economic finality** than staking.

## 2. Consensus Security Analysis

### 2.1 Commit-Reveal Strengths

```
1. Prevents front-running and manipulation
2. Two-phase process adds security
3. Reputation system punishes bad actors
4. Dynamic timing prevents timing attacks
```

### 2.2 Attack Scenarios

#### Scenario A: 51% Attack
```
Attacker controls 51% of nodes
Cost: 51,000 - 510,000 QNA (burned forever)
Success rate: High for double-spend
Mitigation: Social intervention + checkpoints
Economic sense: NO - permanent loss exceeds gains
```

#### Scenario B: Censorship Attack
```
Attacker censors specific transactions
Cost: Need 34%+ of nodes (170+ nodes)
Success rate: Moderate
Mitigation: Reputation penalties + node diversity
Economic sense: NO - reputation loss = future income loss
```

#### Scenario C: Network Split Attack
```
Attacker creates competing chain during partition
Cost: Proportional to partition size
Success rate: Low - diversity checks prevent
Mitigation: Fork choice prefers diverse chains
Economic sense: NO - minority chain rejected
```

### 2.3 Mathematical Security Model

```python
# Security score calculation
def calculate_security_score(network_state):
    # Economic security (burn amounts)
    economic_security = sum(node.burn_amount for node in nodes)
    
    # Decentralization (Nakamoto coefficient)
    nakamoto_coef = calculate_nakamoto_coefficient(nodes)
    
    # Diversity score
    diversity = calculate_diversity(nodes)
    
    # Time-based security (chain age)
    chain_maturity = min(chain_age / target_age, 1.0)
    
    return {
        'economic': economic_security,
        'decentralization': nakamoto_coef,
        'diversity': diversity,
        'maturity': chain_maturity,
        'overall': geometric_mean([economic_security, nakamoto_coef, diversity, chain_maturity])
    }
```

## 3. Unique Security Properties

### 3.1 Burn-to-Join Advantages

1. **Permanent Commitment**: No "stake and run" attacks
2. **Transparent Entry**: All burns visible on-chain
3. **Natural Sybil Resistance**: Linear cost with no return
4. **Aligned Incentives**: Success of network = node profitability

### 3.2 Commit-Reveal Advantages

1. **MEV Resistance**: Commits hide intentions
2. **Fair Ordering**: Reputation-based selection
3. **Adaptive Security**: Dynamic timing prevents gaming
4. **Gradual Trust**: New nodes start with low reputation

## 4. Security Metrics

### 4.1 Required Security Thresholds

```yaml
Minimum_Active_Nodes: 10          # Absolute minimum
Target_Active_Nodes: 1000         # Healthy network
Minimum_Diversity_Score: 0.3      # Prevent centralization
Maximum_Reorg_Depth: 100          # Limit rollbacks
Checkpoint_Interval: 1000         # Finality checkpoints
Reputation_Recovery_Time: 30_days # After misbehavior
```

### 4.2 Attack Cost Analysis

```
Small Network (100 nodes):
- 51% attack: 5,100 - 51,000 QNA
- Monthly operating profit per node: ~1,470 QNC
- Break-even time: Never (QNA burned, QNC earned)

Large Network (10,000 nodes):
- 51% attack: 510,000 - 5,100,000 QNA
- Attack cost in USD (at $1/QNA): $510K - $5.1M
- Comparable to: Mid-size PoS chains
```

## 5. Comparison with Other Consensus Models

| Metric | Bitcoin (PoW) | Ethereum (PoS) | QNet (Burn+CR) |
|--------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| Attack Cost | Hardware + Electricity | 33% of stake | 51% burn (permanent) |
| Finality | Probabilistic (~1hr) | 12-15 min | 100 blocks (~100s) |
| Recovery | Possible | Possible | Impossible |
| Throughput | 7 TPS | 30 TPS | 100K TPS |
| Energy | Very High | Low | Low |

## 6. Vulnerabilities and Mitigations

### 6.1 Potential Vulnerabilities

1. **Bootstrap Phase**: Few nodes = easier attack
   - *Mitigation*: Start with trusted nodes, gradual opening

2. **Reputation Gaming**: Slow reputation building
   - *Mitigation*: Multiple metrics, historical tracking

3. **Wealth Concentration**: Rich can buy many nodes
   - *Mitigation*: Logarithmic scoring, diversity requirements

4. **Social Engineering**: Convincing nodes to misbehave
   - *Mitigation*: Economic incentives outweigh bribes

### 6.2 Security Assumptions

1. **Rational Actors**: Nodes act in economic self-interest
2. **Network Connectivity**: No permanent partitions
3. **Cryptographic Security**: SHA-256, Ed25519 remain secure
4. **Social Layer**: Community can coordinate in crisis

## 7. Conclusion

### 7.1 Overall Security Assessment

**Rating: 8.5/10** - Very Secure with proper parameters

**Strengths**:
- Permanent economic commitment (burn)
- No nothing-at-stake problem
- High cost of attack relative to gain
- Built-in reputation system
- MEV resistance

**Considerations**:
- Requires minimum network size for security
- Depends on QNA token value
- Social coordination needed for extreme events

### 7.2 Recommendations

1. **Launch Strategy**: Start with 100+ genesis nodes
2. **Monitoring**: Track diversity metrics continuously
3. **Checkpoints**: Implement social checkpoints every 10K blocks
4. **Emergency**: Have pause mechanism for critical bugs
5. **Audits**: Regular security audits of implementation

### 7.3 Security Comparison Summary

QNet's burn-to-join model provides **stronger economic security** than traditional PoS, while Commit-Reveal adds **manipulation resistance**. The combination creates a robust system where attacks are:

1. **Expensive** - Must burn tokens permanently
2. **Visible** - All burns are public
3. **Unprofitable** - Cost exceeds potential gains
4. **Traceable** - Reputation system tracks behavior

**Final Verdict**: The model is **highly secure** for a high-throughput blockchain, with security increasing as the network grows.
