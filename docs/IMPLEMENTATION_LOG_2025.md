# QNet Implementation Log - January 2025

## Session: Micro/Macro Block Implementation

### Date: January 6, 2025

### Starting State
- P2P connections working correctly
- Basic blockchain with 90-second blocks
- 4 TPS performance
- 2 nodes successfully connecting

### Work Completed

#### 1. Fixed transaction.rs Issue
- **Problem**: File encoding issues in Windows preventing compilation
- **Solution**: Recreated file with proper UTF-8 encoding
- **Result**: qnet-state module now compiles successfully

#### 2. Added Micro/Macro Block Structures
Created new block types in `qnet-state/src/block.rs`:
```rust
- BlockType enum (Standard/Micro/Macro)
- MicroBlock structure
- MacroBlock structure  
- LightMicroBlock for mobile nodes
- ConsensusData for consensus info
```

#### 3. Updated Consensus Engine
Modified `qnet-consensus/src/lib.rs`:
```rust
- Added microblock_interval config (1 second)
- Added microblocks_per_macro config (90)
- Implemented validate_microblock()
- Implemented run_macro_consensus()
- Added leader rotation logic
```

#### 4. Started Node Integration
Began updating `qnet-integration/src/node.rs`:
```rust
- Added create_microblock() method
- Added trigger_macroblock_consensus() 
- Added handle_microblock/handle_macroblock
- Added microblock tracking fields
```

### Current Issues

1. **Compilation Errors in qnet-integration**
   - Missing imports for new block types
   - Method signature mismatches
   - P2P message structure updates needed

2. **Incomplete Implementation**
   - P2P protocol needs microblock message types
   - RPC methods need updates for new blocks
   - Storage layer needs optimization

### Performance Impact
- No performance testing yet (compilation errors)
- Expected: 100K+ TPS with microblocks
- Current: Still at 4 TPS

### Next Steps

1. **Fix Integration Module**
   - Update imports
   - Fix method signatures
   - Update P2P messages

2. **Complete Implementation**
   - Add gossip protocol
   - Update RPC methods
   - Optimize storage

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for micro/macro blocks
   - Integration tests
   - Performance benchmarks

### Code Quality
- Clean separation of concerns
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Documentation updated

### Time Spent
- ~3 hours on implementation
- Major progress despite Windows file encoding issues

### Lessons Learned
1. Windows PowerShell file creation can cause encoding issues
2. Better to use edit_file tool consistently
3. Incremental compilation helps catch issues early

### Overall Assessment
Good progress on micro/macro block architecture. Foundation is solid, but needs completion of integration layer. Once compilation issues are fixed, we can test the performance improvements.
