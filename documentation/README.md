## üöÄ Quick Start

### Three-Layer Architecture

#### 1. $1DEV Fun Token (Solana)
**Purpose**: Fun memecoin for experimental network testing via pump.fun mechanism  
**Requirement**: Variable $1DEV tokens burned based on node type  

```bash
# Dynamic pricing based on network burn progress (exponential decay curve)
Light Node:  1,500-150 $1DEV burned (decreases as total network burn % increases)
Full Node:   1,500-150 $1DEV burned (decreases as total network burn % increases)  
Super Node:  1,500-150 $1DEV burned (decreases as total network burn % increases)

# Price reduction mechanism:
# 0% burned: 1,500 $1DEV per node
# 50% burned: ~750 $1DEV per node  
# 90% burned: 150 $1DEV per node (minimum price)
# Formula: price = 150 + (1350 * (1 - burn_percentage)^2)
```

#### 2. QNet Blockchain (Native)
**Performance**: 424,411 TPS achieved (verified June 2025) ‚ö°  
**Architecture**: Microblock + Macroblock hybrid  

```
Microblocks: 1 second intervals
Macroblocks: 90 second intervals (90 microblocks)
```

#### 3. QNC Native Token (Post-Transition)
**Mechanism**: QNC payment to Pool #3 (no burning, redistributed to all active nodes)  
**Transition**: At 90% $1DEV burned OR 5 years

```bash
# Phase 2: Dynamic QNC pricing based on network size
Light Node:  2,500-15,000 QNC (base: 5,000 QNC)
Full Node:   3,750-22,500 QNC (base: 7,500 QNC)  
Super Node:  5,000-30,000 QNC (base: 10,000 QNC)

# Network size multipliers:
# 0-100K nodes: 0.5x (early network discount)
# 100K-1M nodes: 1.0x (standard pricing)  
# 1M-10M nodes: 2.0x (high demand)
# 10M+ nodes: 3.0x (mature network premium)

# ALL activation fees ‚Üí Pool #3 ‚Üí Equal distribution to ALL active nodes
```

// All node types: 1500-150 $1DEV (decreases as network burn progress increases)
await burnTokensOnSolana(burnAmount, nodeType);
```

### Phase 2: QNC Native (Future)
```rust
// Simple QNC spending to Pool 3 (no burning)
let required_balance = match node_type {
    NodeType::Light => 5_000,
    NodeType::Full => 7_500,
    NodeType::Super => 10_000,
