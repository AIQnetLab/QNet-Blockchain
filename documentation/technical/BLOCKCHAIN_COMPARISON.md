# Blockchain Performance Comparison

## Current State vs Potential

| Blockchain | Core Language | Current TPS | Theoretical Max | Consensus | Smart Contracts |
|------------|---------------|-------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **QNet (Now)** | Python + Rust | 100K | 150K | Commit-Reveal + Reputation | WASM |
| **QNet (Future)** | Rust | 500K+ | 1M+ | Optimized CR + Reputation | WASM |
| Solana | Rust | 65K | 710K | PoH + PoS | Rust/C |
| Aptos | Rust | 160K | 160K | AptosBFT | Move |
| Sui | Rust | 120K | 297K | Narwhal/Tusk | Move |
| Ethereum | Go | 30 | 100K (L2) | PoS | EVM |
| Avalanche | Go | 4.5K | 20K | Avalanche | EVM |
| Near | Rust | 100K | 100K | Nightshade | WASM |
| Polkadot | Rust | 1K | 1M (parachains) | GRANDPA | WASM |

## QNet's Unique Consensus: Commit-Reveal + Reputation

### How It Works:

1. **Commit Phase**:
   - Validators commit hash of their proposed value
   - Prevents front-running and manipulation
   - Adaptive timing based on network conditions

2. **Reveal Phase**:
   - Validators reveal actual values
   - Only valid reveals from commit phase accepted
   - Reputation system tracks participation

3. **Leader Selection**:
   - Deterministic selection using SHA256
   - Weighted by node reputation
   - Higher reputation = higher chance of selection

4. **Reputation System**:
   - Participation: 40% weight
   - Response time: 30% weight  
   - Block quality: 30% weight
   - Real-time tracking and updates

### Advantages Over Traditional Consensus:

- **Front-running Protection**: Commit-reveal prevents value manipulation
- **Adaptive Performance**: Dynamic timing adjusts to network conditions
- **Fair Leader Selection**: Reputation-based, not just stake-based
- **Sybil Resistance**: Reputation harder to fake than just stake

## QNet Performance Analysis

### Current Architecture (Python + Rust hybrid)
- **Achieved**: 100K TPS with Rust optimization modules
- **Bottleneck**: Python consensus and state management
- **Latency**: 50ms API response time
- **Finality**: 10 seconds

### After Full Rust Migration
- **Target**: 500K+ TPS base, 1M+ with sharding
- **Improvements**:
  - Consensus: 10x faster (10s → 1s)
  - State access: 10x faster
  - API latency: 10x faster (50ms → 5ms)
  - Memory usage: 5x reduction

## Why QNet Can Achieve 500K+ TPS

### 1. Architecture Advantages
- **Hierarchical node structure**: Super/Full/Light nodes
- **Optimized consensus**: Only super nodes validate
- **Parallel transaction processing**: Rust's fearless concurrency

- **Progressive sync**: Only recent state needed
- **Batch validation**: Efficient proof verification

## Realistic Performance Targets

### Phase 1 (Current - Python/Rust Hybrid)
- **TPS**: 100,000 (achieved)
- **Finality**: 10 seconds
- **Nodes**: 10,000

### Phase 2 (Rust Core Migration)
- **TPS**: 250,000
- **Finality**: 3 seconds
- **Nodes**: 100,000

### Phase 3 (Full Optimization)
- **TPS**: 500,000+
- **Finality**: 1 second
- **Nodes**: 1,000,000+

### Phase 4 (With Sharding)
- **TPS**: 1,000,000+
- **Finality**: Sub-second
- **Nodes**: 10,000,000+

## Comparison Details
