# QNet Smart Contracts Integration Tasks

> Status (2026-07): superseded historical task log. Several items below describe an
> architecture that no longer matches current reality — correct these against the
> live system: (1) there is NO "Post-Quantum EVM" (`pq_evm` was deleted); smart
> contracts run on a deterministic WASM VM (`wasmi`, fuel = gas) with on-chain
> QRC-20 and QRC-721 standards and cross-contract calls (EIP-2930-style access list).
> (2) Signatures are pure ML-DSA-65 (Dilithium3), NOT "Hybrid Dilithium2 + Ed25519" —
> the Ed25519 removal is complete; the only remaining hybrid is the X25519Kyber768
> (ML-KEM-768) TLS 1.3 transport key exchange. (3) Sharding is deferred and OFF
> (single-shard); "cross-shard" claims are not live. (4) Solana burn is proof-of-burn,
> not staking. The task-completion history is kept as-is below for the record.
