## 💰 QNA Token Economics

### Total Supply & Distribution
```
QNA Token Supply:
├── Total Supply: 21,000,000 QNA (fixed)
├── Genesis: Fair launch, no pre-mine
├── Halving: Every 4 years (Bitcoin model)
└── Burn Mechanism: Deflationary pressure
```

### Burn-to-Join Node Activation

#### Current Burn Requirements (Decreasing Over Time):
```
Node Activation Costs:
├── Light Node: 100 QNA (down from 1,000 QNA)
├── Full Node: 150 QNA (down from 1,500 QNA)  
├── Super Node: 200 QNA (down from 2,000 QNA)
└── Trend: Decreasing to encourage adoption
```

#### Burn Process Integration:
1. **Purchase QNA**: On Solana DEX (Jupiter, Raydium)
2. **Burn Transaction**: Send to designated burn address
3. **Solana Verification**: Node software verifies burn on-chain
4. **Automatic Activation**: Immediate node activation post-verification

### 📊 Revenue Streams

#### 1. Transaction Fees (Real-time)
```
Fee Distribution (Per Transaction):
├── 70% → Super Nodes (producers/validators)
├── 30% → Full Nodes (network participants)
└── 0% → Light Nodes (pure consumers)

Estimated Revenue (281k TPS):
├── Daily Transactions: 24.3 billion
├── Average Fee: 0.0001 QNA
├── Daily Revenue: 2.43 million QNA
└── Annual Revenue: 887 million QNA
```

#### 2. Base Rewards (Every 4 Hours)
```
Equal Distribution Schedule:
├── Year 1: 24.51 QNA per node (every 4 hours)
├── Year 2: 24.51 QNA per node  
├── Year 3: 24.51 QNA per node
├── Year 4: 24.51 QNA per node
├── Year 5: 12.255 QNA per node (halving)
└── Continues halving every 4 years
```

## 🔄 Lazy Rewards System (No Rate Limiting)

### Operator-Controlled Claiming
**MAJOR UPDATE**: Rate limiting removed for better user experience

#### Old System (Removed):
- ❌ Reward claims limited to once per hour
- ❌ Minimum claim: 0.1 QNA
- ❌ Inconvenient for operators

#### New System (Active):
- ✅ **No time restrictions**: Claim anytime
- ✅ **Minimum claim**: 1.0 QNA (prevents spam)
- ✅ **Operator convenience**: Flexible claiming schedule
- ✅ **Accumulated rewards**: Build up over time

### Benefits of New System:
1. **Better UX**: Operators claim when convenient
2. **Fewer Network Transactions**: Reduced congestion
3. **Flexible Schedule**: No forced claiming pressure
4. **Spam Prevention**: 1.0 QNA minimum maintains network quality

## 📈 Economic Incentives

### Educational Participation Incentives

#### Super Node Economics (200 QNA burn):
```
Revenue Streams:
├── Base Rewards: 24.51 QNA every 4 hours
├── Transaction Fees: 70% share of network fees
├── Daily Base: 147.06 QNA (6 × 24.51)
├── Educational Access: 200 $1DEV tokens burned
└── Learning Incentives: Enhanced educational rewards
```

#### Full Node Economics (150 QNA burn):
```
Revenue Streams:
├── Base Rewards: 24.51 QNA every 4 hours
├── Transaction Fees: 30% share of network fees
├── Daily Base: 147.06 QNA (6 × 24.51)
├── Educational Access: 150 $1DEV tokens burned
└── Learning Incentives: Moderate educational rewards
```

#### Light Node Economics (100 QNA burn):
```
Revenue Streams:
├── Base Rewards: 24.51 QNA every 4 hours
├── Transaction Fees: 0% (no rewards)
├── Daily Base: 147.06 QNA (6 × 24.51)
├── Educational Access: 100 $1DEV tokens burned
└── Learning Incentives: Basic educational rewards
```

### 🎯 Network Economics at Scale

#### 80-Node Production Network:
```
Network Capacity:
├── Theoretical TPS: 22.4M+ (80 × 281k TPS)
├── Daily Transactions: 1.94 trillion
├── Daily Fee Revenue: 194 million QNA
├── Node Operator Share: 194M QNA daily
└── Network Sustainability: Self-funding
```

## 🔥 Deflationary Mechanisms

### Burn Events
1. **Node Activation**: All activation burns are permanent
2. **Transaction Fees**: Portion of fees burned (if configured)
3. **Penalty Burns**: Misbehaving nodes lose staked QNA
4. **Upgrade Burns**: Protocol upgrades may require burns

### Supply Reduction Timeline:
```
Year 1: ~50,000 QNA burned (node activations)
Year 2: ~100,000 QNA burned (growth phase)
Year 3: ~200,000 QNA burned (mainstream adoption)
Year 5: ~500,000 QNA burned (enterprise adoption)
Total: ~850,000 QNA burned in 5 years (4% of supply)
```
