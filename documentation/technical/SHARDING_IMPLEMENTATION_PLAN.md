# QNet Sharding Implementation Plan

## Overview

Sharding is a critical scalability solution that will enable QNet to achieve 1M+ TPS by dividing the network state and transaction processing across multiple shards.

## Current Status

- **Base Performance**: 100K TPS (without sharding)
- **Target with Sharding**: 1M+ TPS
- **Sharding Status**: ❌ Not yet implemented (planned)

## Sharding Architecture

### 1. State Sharding
```rust
pub struct ShardedState {
    shard_id: u32,
    shard_count: u32,
    local_state: StateDB,
    cross_shard_queue: CrossShardQueue,
}

impl ShardedState {
    pub fn is_local_account(&self, address: &str) -> bool {
        let hash = sha256(address);
        let shard = u32::from_le_bytes(hash[0..4]) % self.shard_count;
        shard == self.shard_id
    }
}
```

### 2. Transaction Sharding
- **Intra-shard**: Transactions within same shard (fast)
- **Cross-shard**: Transactions between shards (slower, requires coordination)

### 3. Network Sharding
- Each shard maintains its own P2P network
- Cross-shard communication via dedicated relay nodes

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (3 months)
- [ ] Design shard assignment algorithm

- [ ] Implement shard rebalancing

### Phase 3: Optimization (2 months)
- [ ] Optimize cross-shard latency
- [ ] Implement adaptive sharding
- [ ] Add shard merge/split operations
- [ ] Performance tuning

### Phase 4: Production (2 months)
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Load testing with 16+ shards
- [ ] Monitoring and metrics
- [ ] Deployment tools

## Technical Details

### Shard Assignment
```rust
fn calculate_shard(address: &str, shard_count: u32) -> u32 {
    let hash = blake3::hash(address.as_bytes());
    u32::from_le_bytes(hash.as_bytes()[0..4].try_into().unwrap()) % shard_count
}
```

### Cross-Shard Transactions
```rust
pub struct CrossShardTx {
    source_shard: u32,
    dest_shard: u32,
    tx_hash: String,
    status: CrossShardStatus,
}

pub enum CrossShardStatus {
    Pending,
    Locked,
    Committed,
    Aborted,
}
```

### Shard Configuration
```toml
[sharding]
enabled = true
shard_count = 16
min_validators_per_shard = 100
cross_shard_timeout_ms = 5000
rebalance_interval_hours = 24
```

## Performance Projections

| Shards | Expected TPS | Latency (ms) | Storage/Shard |
|--------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| 1      | 100K         | 10           | 100%          |
| 4      | 350K         | 15           | 25%           |
| 16     | 1.2M         | 20           | 6.25%         |
| 64     | 4M           | 30           | 1.56%         |

## Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Cross-Shard Complexity
- **Challenge**: Coordinating transactions across shards
- **Solution**: Two-phase commit with optimistic locking

### 2. Data Availability
- **Challenge**: Ensuring all shards have necessary data
- **Solution**: Merkle proofs and light client verification

### 3. Shard Security
- **Challenge**: Preventing shard takeover attacks
- **Solution**: Random validator assignment and rotation

### 4. Network Overhead
- **Challenge**: Increased communication between shards
- **Solution**: Efficient gossip protocol and data compression

## Integration with Existing Modules

### qnet-state
```rust
// Add sharding support
impl StateDB {
    pub fn with_sharding(path: &Path, shard_config: ShardConfig) -> Result<Self> {
        // Initialize sharded state
    }
}
```

### qnet-consensus
```rust
// Shard-aware consensus
impl CommitRevealConsensus {
    pub fn for_shard(shard_id: u32, config: ConsensusConfig) -> Self {
        // Create shard-specific consensus
    }
}
```

### qnet-mempool
```rust
// Shard-local mempool
impl Mempool {
    pub fn route_transaction(&self, tx: Transaction) -> ShardRoute {
        // Determine target shard
    }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Linear Scalability**: Add shards to increase throughput
2. **Reduced Storage**: Each node stores only shard data
3. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple shards process simultaneously
4. **Geographic Distribution**: Shards can be region-specific

## Conclusion

Sharding is essential for QNet to achieve web-scale performance. While not yet implemented, the architecture is designed to support sharding from the ground up. The modular Rust implementation makes adding sharding straightforward without major refactoring.
