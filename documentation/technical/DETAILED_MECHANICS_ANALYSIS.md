# QNet Blockchain: Detailed Mechanics Analysis

## Executive Summary

After deep code analysis, here's what QNet ACTUALLY implements vs what documentation claims:

### Reality Check
- **Consensus**: ✅ Commit-reveal implemented (60s commit, 30s reveal)
- **Sharding**: ⚠️ Basic structure, NOT 10,000 shards as claimed
- **Performance**: ❌ NOT 5,000 TPS currently (theoretical at best)
- **Wallet**: ✅ Ed25519 crypto properly implemented
- **API**: ⚠️ Python with Rust bindings, NOT pure Go as suggested

## 1. Consensus Mechanism (ACTUAL)

### Commit-Reveal Process
```rust
// From commit_reveal.rs
Phase 1: Commit (60 seconds)
- Nodes generate random value + nonce
- Hash = blake3(value:nonce)
- Submit hash with signature

Phase 2: Reveal (30 seconds)  
- Nodes reveal value:nonce
- System verifies hash matches
- Update reputation for valid reveals

Phase 3: Leader Selection
- Filter nodes by reputation >= 0.5
- Weighted random selection based on reputation
- NO EXTRA REWARDS for being leader!
```

### Reputation System
```rust
// Default config from types.rs
- history_size: 100 rounds
- default_reputation: 0.5
- penalty_invalid_reveal: 0.2
- penalty_mining_failure: 0.1
- reward_participation: 0.05
- reward_leader: 0.1 (but NOT used for rewards!)
- decay_factor: 0.95
```

## 2. Transaction Structure (ACTUAL)

### Transaction Fields
```rust
// From transaction.rs
pub struct Transaction {
    hash: String,           // Blake3 hash
    from: String,          // Sender address
    to: Option<String>,    // Recipient (optional for contracts)
    amount: u64,           // Amount in smallest unit
    nonce: u64,            // Account nonce
    gas_price: u64,        // Gas price (added for compatibility)
    gas_limit: u64,        // Gas limit (added for compatibility)
    timestamp: u64,        // Unix timestamp
    signature: Option<String>, // Ed25519 signature
    tx_type: TransactionType,  // Transfer/NodeActivation/etc
    data: Option<String>,      // Additional data
}
```

### Transaction Types
1. **Transfer** - Simple value transfer
2. **NodeActivation** - Burn tokens to activate node
3. **ContractDeploy** - Deploy smart contract (NOT implemented)
4. **ContractCall** - Call smart contract (NOT implemented)
5. **RewardDistribution** - Distribute rewards

## 3. State Management (ACTUAL)

### In-Memory Database
```rust
// From state_db.rs
pub struct StateDB {
    accounts: Arc<DashMap<String, Account>>,  // All accounts
    blocks: Arc<RwLock<Vec<Block>>>,         // All blocks
    state_root: Arc<RwLock<String>>,         // Current state hash
}
```

**NO PERSISTENT STORAGE!** Everything is in memory only.

### Account Structure
```rust
pub struct Account {
    address: String,
    balance: u64,
    nonce: u64,
    is_node: bool,
    node_type: Option<String>,  // "light", "full", "super"
    stake: u64,
    reputation: f64,
    created_at: u64,
    updated_at: u64,
}
```

## 4. Mempool Implementation (ACTUAL)

### Features
- ✅ **Parallel validation** using DashMap
- ✅ **Priority queue** based on gas price
- ✅ **Eviction policies** (time-based, priority-based)
- ✅ **Per-account limits** (100 tx max)
- ✅ **Nonce gap detection**

### Configuration
```rust
// Default from mempool.rs
max_size: 50,000 transactions
max_per_account: 100
min_gas_price: 1
tx_expiry: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
eviction_interval: 60 seconds
```

## 5. Network Layer (ACTUAL)

### Go Implementation (qnet-network)
- Uses libp2p for P2P
- DHT for peer discovery
- Gossipsub for message propagation
- **STILL USES JSON** (Protocol Buffers not implemented)

### Message Types
```go
// From main.go
- BlockAnnounce
- TransactionBroadcast
- ConsensusCommit
- ConsensusReveal
- NodePing
```

## 6. Wallet Security (ACTUAL)

### Cryptography
```javascript
// From SecureCrypto.js
- Ed25519 key generation via Web Crypto API
- PBKDF2 with 250,000 iterations
- AES-GCM encryption
- 32-byte random salt per password
- Proper signature verification
```

### Security Features
- ✅ Replay protection (chain ID + nonce)
- ✅ Transaction auditing (pattern detection)
- ✅ Phishing detection
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ Auto-lock after 15 minutes

### Address Format
```
qnet1 + base58(publicKey)
Example: qnet1AbCdEfGhIjKlMnOpQrStUvWxYz123456
```

## 7. API Server (ACTUAL)

### Technology Stack
- **FastAPI** (Python) - NOT Go as suggested
- **Rust bindings** via PyO3
- **WebSocket** support for real-time updates

### Endpoints
```
GET  /api/v1/status          - Node status
GET  /api/v1/balance/{addr}  - Account balance
POST /api/v1/transaction     - Submit transaction
GET  /api/v1/gas-price       - Gas recommendations
WS   /ws                     - Real-time updates
```

## 8. Economic Model (ACTUAL CODE)

### Node Activation
```python
# From api_server_rust.py
Light: 1,000,000 units (hardcoded)
Full:  1,000,000 units (same!)
Super: 1,000,000 units (same!)
```

**NOT DYNAMIC PRICING** as documentation claims!

### Reward Distribution
- **NOT IMPLEMENTED** in current code
- No 4-hour distribution mechanism
- No halving logic
- No fee distribution to nodes

## 9. Performance Analysis

### Current Bottlenecks
1. **In-memory state** - No persistence
2. **JSON serialization** - Not binary protocol
3. **Single-threaded consensus** - No parallelization
4. **No actual sharding** - Just basic structure

### Real Performance
- **Theoretical**: ~500-1000 TPS (with current architecture)
- **Actual**: 0 TPS (no running network)

## 10. Missing Implementations

### Critical Missing Features
1. **Persistent storage** (using RocksDB was removed)
2. **Actual sharding logic** (only interfaces exist)
3. **Reward distribution system**
4. **Smart contracts** (types exist, no execution)
5. **Cross-shard transactions**
6. **State channels**
7. **ZK proofs**
8. **GPU acceleration**

### Partially Implemented
1. **Consensus** - Works but not integrated
2. **Mempool** - Works but not connected to consensus
3. **API** - Works but limited functionality
4. **Wallet** - Works but no mainnet to connect to

## 11. Integration Issues

### Module Communication
```
Wallet (JS) → API (Python) → Rust Modules
                ↓
            JSON-RPC (not efficient)
                ↓
        Network (Go) ← No integration!
```

### Data Flow Problems
1. API creates transactions but doesn't validate signatures
2. Mempool validates but doesn't execute
3. Consensus selects leader but doesn't produce blocks
4. State updates but doesn't persist

## 12. Security Analysis

### Good
- ✅ Ed25519 signatures
- ✅ Proper key derivation
- ✅ Memory encryption in wallet
- ✅ Input validation

### Bad
- ❌ No signature verification in API
- ❌ No Byzantine fault tolerance
- ❌ No slashing for bad behavior
- ❌ No DDoS protection

## 13. Block Creation Process (ACTUAL)

### How Blocks Are Created
```python
# From node.py
1. Leader creates coinbase transaction
2. Selects transactions from mempool (max 1000)
3. Creates Block object with:
   - index (height)
   - timestamp
   - transactions list
   - previous_hash
   - nonce (always 0)
4. Signs block hash
5. Adds to local blockchain
6. Broadcasts to network
```

### Block Structure
```rust
// From block.rs
pub struct Block {
    height: u64,
    timestamp: u64,
    previous_hash: String,
    transactions: Vec<Transaction>,
    state_root: String,
    validator: String,
    consensus_proof: ConsensusProof,
}
```

### Block Processing
```rust
// From state_db.rs
pub async fn process_block(&self, block: Block) {
    // Just stores in HashMap!
    blocks.insert(block.height, block);
}
```

**NO VALIDATION!** Blocks are just stored without checking.

## 14. The Truth About QNet

### What Actually Exists
1. **Wallet** - Functional browser extension with good crypto
2. **Basic Rust modules** - State, mempool, consensus (not connected)
3. **Python API** - Can receive transactions (doesn't process them)
4. **Go network stub** - P2P code exists but not integrated

### What's Missing
1. **No running blockchain** - Modules exist but don't work together
2. **No block validation** - Blocks just stored in memory
3. **No state transitions** - Transactions don't update balances
4. **No persistence** - Everything lost on restart
5. **No actual consensus** - Leader selection works but doesn't create valid blocks

### Architecture Mismatch
```
Documentation says:     Reality:
- Go API               → Python API
- RocksDB storage      → HashMap in memory  
- 10,000 shards        → 0 shards
- 5,000 TPS            → 0 TPS
- Dynamic pricing      → Hardcoded values
- 4-hour rewards       → No rewards
```

## Conclusion

QNet has solid foundational code but is FAR from production ready:

1. **Consensus**: Implemented but not integrated
2. **Performance**: Nowhere near 5,000 TPS claim
3. **Sharding**: Just basic structure, not functional
4. **Economics**: Hardcoded values, no dynamic system
5. **Network**: No running mainnet or testnet

### Reality vs Claims
- **Claimed**: 5,000 TPS, 10,000 shards, dynamic economics
- **Reality**: ~0 TPS, 0 shards, hardcoded values

### What Works
- Wallet cryptography
- Basic transaction structure  
- Mempool logic
- Commit-reveal consensus

### What Doesn't
- No blockchain actually running
- No reward distribution
- No persistent storage
- No real sharding
- No smart contracts

The project has good architecture but needs 6-12 months of development to match documentation claims.

### Honest Assessment
QNet is a **prototype**, not a production blockchain. It has:
- Good ideas and architecture
- Some working components
- No integrated system
- No way to actually run a blockchain

To make it real would require:
1. Connecting all modules properly
2. Implementing persistent storage
3. Adding proper block validation
4. Creating actual sharding logic
5. Building reward distribution
6. Extensive testing and optimization
