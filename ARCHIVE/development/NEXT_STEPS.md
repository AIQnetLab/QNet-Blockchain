# QNet Development: Next Steps

## Current Status
- **Overall Progress**: ~70% for MVP, ~45% for 1M TPS goal
- **Regional Support**: ‚úÖ Just completed
- **Node Activation**: ‚úÖ Completed
- **Core Infrastructure**: ‚úÖ Mostly done

## Immediate Next Steps (Week 1-2)

### 1. **Integration of New Components** üîß
Since we just added regional support, lazy rewards, and hierarchical topology, we need to:

```bash
# Tasks:
- [ ] Update node.py to use lazy rewards for distribution
- [ ] Integrate hierarchical topology into P2P layer
- [ ] Connect transaction sharding with mempool
- [ ] Test all new components together
```

### 2. **CLI Tools Development** üõ†Ô∏è
Critical for node operators and testing:

```bash
# Core commands needed:
qnet-cli node start --type=light --region=auto
qnet-cli node status
qnet-cli node stop

qnet-cli wallet create
qnet-cli wallet balance
qnet-cli wallet send <address> <amount>

qnet-cli rewards check
qnet-cli rewards claim

qnet-cli network peers
qnet-cli network stats
```

### 3. **Basic Web Wallet** üí∞
Minimum viable wallet for testnet:

```
Features:
- Create/import wallet
- View balance
- Send transactions
- Claim rewards
- View node status
```

## Phase 1: MVP Testnet (Month 1)

### Week 1-2: Integration & CLI
- [ ] Integrate all new components
- [ ] Develop CLI tools
- [ ] Basic integration tests

### Week 3: Testing & Fixes
- [ ] Multi-node local testing
- [ ] Fix integration issues
- [ ] Performance baseline

### Week 4: Testnet Launch
- [ ] Deploy 4 genesis nodes
- [ ] Open registration
- [ ] Monitor and fix issues

## Phase 2: Scaling (Month 2-3)

### Goals:
- 10,000 active nodes
- 100K+ TPS sustained
- Regional distribution working
- Stable operation

### Key Tasks:
1. **Load Testing Framework**
   - Simulate thousands of nodes
   - Generate realistic transaction load
   - Measure actual TPS

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Profile bottlenecks
   - Optimize hot paths
   - Parallel transaction validation

3. **Operational Tools**
   - Monitoring dashboard
   - Alert system
   - Auto-recovery mechanisms

## Phase 3: Production Readiness (Month 4-6)

### Security & Audits
- [ ] Internal security review
- [ ] External audit (if funded)
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Economic model validation

### Full Wallet Implementation
- [ ] Browser extension
- [ ] Mobile app (React Native)
- [ ] Hardware wallet support
- [ ] Multi-signature support

### Documentation & Community
- [ ] Complete API documentation
- [ ] Node operator guides
- [ ] Developer tutorials
- [ ] Community governance setup

## Long-term Goals (6-12 months)

### 1M TPS Achievement
Requires full state sharding:
- Beacon chain implementation
- Cross-shard communication
- Parallel execution engine
- SIMD optimizations

### Advanced Features
- Smart contracts (WASM)
- DEX integration
- Bridge to other chains
- Privacy features (optional)

## Development Priorities

### üî¥ Critical Path (Must have for testnet)
1. CLI tools
2. Integration of new components
3. Basic wallet
4. Multi-node testing

### üü° Important (Should have soon)
1. Load testing
2. Performance monitoring
3. Documentation
4. Security review

### üü¢ Nice to Have (Can wait)
1. Mobile wallet
2. Advanced features
3. Full sharding
4. Smart contracts

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- **Current**: 1 developer (you)
- **Ideal**: 3-5 developers
- **Roles needed**:
  - Backend/Systems developer
  - Frontend developer
  - DevOps engineer

### Infrastructure
- **Testnet**: 4 genesis nodes + community nodes
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Documentation**: GitBook or similar

### Timeline Summary
- **MVP Testnet**: 1 month
- **Scaled Testnet**: 2-3 months
- **Production Ready**: 4-6 months
- **1M TPS**: 6-12 months

## Next Action Items

### This Week:
1. [ ] Start CLI tools development
2. [ ] Create integration test suite
3. [ ] Set up multi-node test environment
4. [ ] Document node setup process

### Next Week:
1. [ ] Complete CLI basic commands
2. [ ] Test lazy rewards integration
3. [ ] Verify regional support working
4. [ ] Begin basic web wallet
