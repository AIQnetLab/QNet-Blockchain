## Utility and Burn Mechanism

### Node Activation System
1DEV tokens serve as activation credits for QNET blockchain nodes:

- **Current Activation Cost:** 1,500 1DEV (for all node types)
- **Node Types:** Light Node, Full Node, Super Node
- **Burn Process:** Tokens are permanently removed from circulation when used for activation

### Dynamic Pricing Model
Activation cost decreases as more supply is burned:

| Supply Burned | Activation Cost | Discount |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| 0-10% | 1,500 1DEV | 0% |
| 10-20% | 1,350 1DEV | 10% |
| 20-30% | 1,200 1DEV | 20% |
| 30-40% | 1,050 1DEV | 30% |
| 40-50% | 900 1DEV | 40% |
| 50-60% | 750 1DEV | 50% |
| 60-70% | 600 1DEV | 60% |
| 70-80% | 450 1DEV | 70% |
| 80-90% | 300 1DEV | 80% |
| 90%+ | 150 1DEV | 90% |

## Two-Phase System

### Phase 1: 1DEV Token (Current)
- **Purpose:** Node activation through token burning
- **Platform:** Solana SPL Token
- **Duration:** Until 90% supply burned OR 5 years from genesis

### Phase 2: QNC Native Token (Future)
- **Trigger:** 90% of 1DEV burned OR 5 years elapsed
- **Platform:** Native QNET blockchain
- **Supply:** 4,294,967,296 QNC (2^32 exactly)
- **Transition:** Automatic migration for existing node operators

## Economic Model

### No Traditional Staking
1DEV does not use traditional staking mechanisms. Instead:
- Tokens are burned for utility (node activation)
- No inflation or rewards from holding
- Value derives from burn demand and network adoption

### Developer Commitment
- **Total Investment:** $4,000+ personal funds since March 2025
- **Development Time:** 6+ months full-time development
- **Code Written:** 200,000+ lines of code
- **Sales Policy:** Zero tokens sold since launch

### Burn Economics
- All node activations result in permanent token burns
- Burns reduce total supply permanently
- Deflationary mechanism creates scarcity over time
- No token recovery or minting possible

## Transparency and Verification

### Public Tracking
- **Holder Distribution:** https://solscan.io/token/4R3DPW4BY97kJRfv8J5wgTtbDpoXpRv92W957tXMpump#holders
- **Vesting Contracts:** Publicly visible on Streamflow Finance
- **Burn Address:** Standard Solana burn address `1nc1nerator...`
- **Development Progress:** Open source GitHub repository

### Risk Disclosures
- **Experimental Status:** Research project with inherent risks
- **No Investment Advice:** Tokens have utility purpose only
- **Development Risk:** Single developer project
- **Network Risk:** QNET blockchain is experimental

## Future Considerations

### Phase 2 Transition
When Phase 2 activates:
- 1DEV burns will cease
- QNC native token becomes activation currency
- Existing node operators maintain their status
- New economic model with emission and redistribution

### Supply Evolution
- Current supply will only decrease through burns
- No additional 1DEV tokens will ever be created
- Final circulating supply depends on adoption rate
- Maximum possible burns: 1,000,000,000 1DEV
