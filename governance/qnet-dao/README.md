# QNet DAO Structure

## Overview

QNet is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that manages protocol development, treasury, and key decisions.

## DAO Components

### 1. Governance Token: QNC
- Used for voting on proposals
- Earned through node operation
- Required for creating proposals

### 2. Proposal Types

#### Technical Proposals
- Protocol upgrades
- Smart contract changes
- Network parameter adjustments

#### Economic Proposals
- Reward distribution changes
- Fee structure modifications
- Treasury allocations

#### Community Proposals
- Grant funding
- Partnership decisions
- Marketing initiatives

### 3. Voting Mechanism

#### Proposal Creation
- Minimum 100,000 QNC to create proposal
- 7-day discussion period
- 3-day voting period

#### Voting Power
- 1 QNC = 1 vote
- Node operators get 1.1x multiplier
- Long-term stakers get up to 1.5x multiplier

#### Quorum Requirements
- Technical: 10% of circulating supply
- Economic: 15% of circulating supply
- Community: 5% of circulating supply

### 4. Treasury Management

#### Revenue Sources
- 10% of node activation burns
- Network transaction fees
- Partnership revenues

#### Allocation
- 40% Development fund
- 30% Community grants
- 20% Marketing/Growth
- 10% Emergency reserve

### 5. Multisig Control

#### Core Development Multisig (3/5)
- Controls protocol upgrades
- Emergency actions
- Technical implementations

#### Treasury Multisig (4/7)
- Controls DAO treasury
- Executes approved proposals
- Manages partnerships

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
- Deploy governance contracts
- Set up multisigs
- Initial token distribution

### Phase 2: Activation (Months 4-6)
- Enable proposal creation
- Start voting
- First community grants

### Phase 3: Decentralization (Months 7-12)
- Reduce team control
- Increase community governance
- Full DAO autonomy

## Smart Contracts

### Governance Contract
- Proposal management
- Voting logic
- Execution timelock

### Treasury Contract
- Fund management
- Automatic allocations
- Spending limits

### Staking Contract
- QNC staking for voting power
- Lock periods
- Reward distribution

## Security Measures

1. **Timelock**: 48-hour delay on execution
2. **Veto Power**: Multisig can veto malicious proposals
3. **Gradual Decentralization**: Team control reduces over time
4. **Audit Requirements**: Major changes require security audit

## Getting Involved

1. **Run a Node**: Earn QNC and voting power
2. **Stake QNC**: Increase voting weight
3. **Create Proposals**: Shape the protocol
4. **Vote**: Participate in governance
5. **Build**: Apply for grants
