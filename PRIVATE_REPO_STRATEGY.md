# 🔒 QNet Project - Private Repository Strategy

## 📋 Deployment Plan

### Phase 1: Private Development (Current)
- ✅ Create **private** repository on GitHub
- ✅ Limited access for development team only
- ✅ Safe development and testing
- ✅ Ability for fixes and improvements

### Phase 2: Mainnet Preparation
- 🔄 Final testing
- 🔄 Security audit
- 🔄 User documentation
- 🔄 Release preparation

### Phase 3: Public Launch (Before Mainnet)
- 🚀 Switch to **public** repository
- 🚀 Open source code access
- 🚀 Mainnet launch
- 🚀 Developer community

## 🔐 Private Repository Settings

### Access Control:
- **Owner**: Your GitHub account
- **Collaborators**: Development team
- **AI Assistant**: Access via GitHub API (if needed)

### Branches:
- `main` - stable version
- `develop` - active development  
- `feature/*` - new features
- `hotfix/*` - critical fixes

### Protection:
- ✅ Branch protection rules
- ✅ Required reviews
- ✅ Status checks
- ✅ No force push to main

## 📝 Setup Instructions

### 1. Creating Repository on GitHub:

```bash
# Initialize Git (if not done already)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# First commit
git commit -m "feat: initial QNet blockchain project setup

- Post-quantum cryptography implementation
- High-performance consensus mechanism  
- Web3 explorer interface
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Professional monorepo structure
- Size optimized: 11MB (99.96% reduction from 30GB)"

# Add remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/qnet-project.git

# Push to private repository
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Repository Settings:

#### In GitHub Settings:
- **Visibility**: Private ✅
- **Features**: 
  - Issues ✅
  - Projects ✅  
  - Wiki ✅
  - Discussions ✅
- **Security**:
  - Dependency alerts ✅
  - Security advisories ✅
  - Code scanning ✅

#### Branch Protection (Settings → Branches):
```
Branch name pattern: main
☑ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100 MB
☑ Require a pull request before merging
☑ Require status checks to pass before merging
☑ Require branches to be up to date before merging
☑ Include administrators
```

### 3. Adding Collaborators:

#### Settings → Manage access → Invite a collaborator:
- Add team members with **Write** or **Maintain** role
- For external consultants - **Read** role

## 🚀 Private Approach Benefits

### Security:
- 🔒 Protection from code copying before release
- 🔒 Access control to critical components
- 🔒 Safe testing of economic models

### Development:
- 🛠️ Ability to experiment without public pressure
- 🛠️ Bug fixes before public release
- 🛠️ Iterative development

### Marketing:
- 📢 Controlled announcement
- 📢 Community preparation
- 📢 Professional launch

## 📅 Timeline

### Phase 1: Private Development (1-3 months)
- Feature development
- Performance testing
- Bug fixes
- Documentation preparation

### Phase 2: Closed Testing (1 month)
- Alpha testing with limited group
- Feedback collection
- Final fixes

### Phase 3: Public Launch
- Switch to public repository
- Community announcement
- Mainnet launch
- Open for contributors

## 🔄 Transition to Public Repository

### When ready:
1. Settings → General → Danger Zone
2. "Change repository visibility"
3. Select "Make public"
4. Confirm action

### Preparation for publication:
- ✅ Final code review
- ✅ README update
- ✅ CONTRIBUTING.md preparation
- ✅ Release v1.0.0 creation
- ✅ Social media announcement
