## 🧪 Test Results

### Test 1: Database Substitution Attack
**Purpose:** Verify instant ban for attempting to substitute database with alternate chain

**Test Scenario:**
```
Initial: Node reputation 85%
Attack: MaliciousBehavior::DatabaseSubstitution
Expected: Instant 1-year ban + reputation → 0%
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Node instantly jailed: TRUE
- ✅ Jail duration: 8760 hours (1 year)
- ✅ Reputation destroyed: 85% → 0%
- ✅ Offense count: 999 (triggers maximum)

**Status:** ✅ PASSED

---

### Test 2: Storage Deletion During Leadership
**Purpose:** Verify instant ban for deleting database while being active block producer

**Test Scenario:**
```
Initial: Leader node reputation 90%
Attack: MaliciousBehavior::StorageDeletion (during block production)
Expected: Instant 1-year ban + reputation → 0%
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Node instantly jailed: TRUE
- ✅ Jail duration: 8760 hours (1 year)
- ✅ Reputation destroyed: 90% → 0%
- ✅ Emergency failover triggered

**Status:** ✅ PASSED

---

### Test 3: Chain Fork Attack
**Purpose:** Verify instant ban for creating or promoting blockchain fork

**Test Scenario:**
```
Initial: Node reputation 75%
Attack: MaliciousBehavior::ChainFork
Expected: Instant 1-year ban + reputation → 0%
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Node instantly jailed: TRUE
- ✅ Jail duration: 8760 hours (1 year)
- ✅ Reputation destroyed: 75% → 0%
- ✅ Fork detection successful

**Status:** ✅ PASSED

---

### Test 4: Critical vs Regular Violations
**Purpose:** Verify that critical attacks receive maximum penalty vs progressive system for regular violations

**Test Scenario:**
```
Regular violation: InvalidConsensus (node reputation 80%)
Critical attack: DatabaseSubstitution (node reputation 80%)
```

**Results:**

| Violation Type | Jail Duration | Reputation | Penalty Type |
|----------------|---------------|------------|--------------|
| Regular (InvalidConsensus) | 1 hour | 0% (while jailed) | Progressive |
| Critical (DatabaseSubstitution) | 8760 hours | 0% (destroyed) | Instant Maximum |

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Regular violations: Progressive jail system (1h → 24h → 7d → 30d → 3m → 1y)
- ✅ Critical attacks: Instant maximum (8760 hours)
- ✅ Proper differentiation between violation types

**Status:** ✅ PASSED

---

### Test 5: Genesis Node Critical Attack
**Purpose:** Verify that even Genesis nodes receive maximum penalty for critical attacks (no special protection)

**Test Scenario:**
```
Genesis node (genesis_node_001) with 85% reputation
Commits: MaliciousBehavior::ChainFork
Expected: Same punishment as regular nodes
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Genesis node jailed: TRUE
- ✅ Jail duration: 8760 hours (1 year, same as regular)
- ✅ Reputation: 0% (while jailed)
- ✅ No special protection for critical attacks

**Key Finding:**
Genesis nodes have NO special protection for critical attacks. They receive the same maximum penalty as regular nodes, ensuring network integrity over individual node protection.

**Status:** ✅ PASSED

---

### Test 6: Multiple Critical Attacks from Same Node
**Purpose:** Verify handling of repeated critical attacks from persistent attacker

**Test Scenario:**
```
Node commits DatabaseSubstitution (reputation → 0%)
Same node commits StorageDeletion (already banned)
```

**Results:**
- ✅ First attack: Reputation destroyed (90% → 0%)
- ✅ Still jailed after first attack
- ✅ Second attack: Reputation remains 0%
- ✅ No further degradation possible (already at minimum)

**Status:** ✅ PASSED

---

## 📋 Attack Types and Penalties

### Regular Violations (Progressive System):
| Violation | 1st Offense | 2nd Offense | 3rd+ Offense |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| InvalidConsensus | 1 hour | 24 hours | 7d → 30d → 3m → 1y |
| DoubleSign | 1 hour + -50 rep | 24 hours | Progressive |
| TimeManipulation | 1 hour + -20 rep | 24 hours | Progressive |
| NetworkFlooding | 1 hour + -10 rep | 24 hours | Progressive |

### Critical Attacks (Instant Maximum):
| Attack | Penalty | Jail | Reputation | Recovery |
|--------|---------|------|------------|----------|
| DatabaseSubstitution | INSTANT | 8760h (1y) | -100% | Impossible |
| ChainFork | INSTANT | 8760h (1y) | -100% | Impossible |
| StorageDeletion | INSTANT | 8760h (1y) | -100% | Impossible |

## 🛡️ Protection Mechanisms

### Detection:
1. **Chain Integrity Validation** (node.rs:1038-1105)
   - Verifies previous_hash continuity
   - Detects database substitution attempts
   - Rejects blocks with invalid chain linkage

2. **Fork Detection** (node.rs:1084-1116)
   - Checks if block already exists with different hash
   - Prevents history rewriting attacks
   - Immediate rejection and attacker identification

3. **Storage Failure Detection** (node.rs:2064-2087)
   - Monitors save_microblock() errors
   - Triggers emergency failover on storage failure
   - Broadcasts critical attack to network

### Punishment:
1. **Reputation Destruction** (reputation.rs:447-451)
   - Critical attacks: -100 reputation (instant)
   - Regular violations: -5 to -50 (progressive)

2. **Maximum Jail** (reputation.rs:406-418)
   - Critical attacks: jail_count = 999 (triggers maximum)
   - Results in 8760-hour ban (1 year)

3. **Network Broadcast** (unified_p2p.rs:5771-5798)
   - Instant notification to all peers
   - Network-wide isolation of attacker
   - Emergency producer selection
