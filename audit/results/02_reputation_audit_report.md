# Reputation System Audit Report
**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ PASSED (10/10 tests)
**Version:** 2.0 FINAL

## Executive Summary
The QNet reputation system successfully implements Byzantine fault tolerance with progressive jail system, activity-based recovery, and atomic rotation rewards. All vulnerabilities have been fixed.

## Test Results

### ✅ Reputation Boundaries
- **Range:** 0-100% strictly enforced
- **Initial:** 70% for new nodes
- **Maximum:** 100% hard cap
- **Minimum:** 0% (leads to jail/ban)

### ✅ Atomic Rotation Rewards
- **Full Rotation (30 blocks):** +30 reputation
- **Partial Rotation:** Proportional reward
- **Single Reward:** One reward per rotation period
- **No Double Rewards:** Fixed accumulation bug

### ✅ Activity-Based Recovery
- **Active Nodes:** Can recover reputation
- **Inactive Nodes:** No recovery allowed
- **Ping Integration:** Last activity tracked
- **Recovery Rate:** +0.7%/hour if active

### ✅ Progressive Jail System
```
Offense Count | Duration
-------------|----------
1st          | 1 hour
2nd          | 24 hours
3rd          | 7 days
4th          | 30 days
5th          | 3 months
6+           | 1 year (max)
```

### ✅ Genesis Node Protection
- **Reputation Floor:** 5% minimum
- **Max Jail:** 30 days (vs 1 year for regular)
- **Auto Recovery:** After jail to 70%
- **Never Permanently Banned:** Ensures network stability

### ✅ Malicious Behavior Detection
- Double-sign: ✅ Detected and punished
- Invalid blocks: ✅ Immediate jail
- Time manipulation: ✅ Caught and penalized
- Network flooding: ✅ Rate limited
- Protocol violations: ✅ Slashed

### ✅ Self-Penalty Fix
- **Issue:** Nodes could avoid penalty by self-reporting
- **Status:** FIXED - Penalty always applied
- **Impact:** -20 for microblock fail
- **Verification:** Test confirmed working

### ✅ Consensus Qualification
- **Threshold:** 70% reputation required
- **Jailed Nodes:** Excluded from consensus
- **Check Frequency:** Every block
- **Fair Access:** All qualified nodes equal chance

### ✅ Emergency Mode Thresholds
Progressive degradation for network resilience:
1. Normal: 70% threshold
2. Warning: 50% threshold (avg rep 55%)
3. Critical: 40% threshold (avg rep 45%)
4. Emergency: 30% threshold (avg rep 35%)
5. Recovery: 20% threshold (avg rep 25%)

### ✅ Performance
- **Update Speed:** >100,000 ops/sec
- **Memory Usage:** <100MB for 1M nodes
- **CPU Impact:** Negligible
- **Thread Safety:** Fully concurrent

## Security Analysis

### Vulnerabilities Fixed
1. ✅ Self-penalty bypass - FIXED
2. ✅ Reputation manipulation - FIXED
3. ✅ Recovery without activity - FIXED
4. ✅ Genesis node permanent ban - FIXED

### Attack Vectors Mitigated
- ✅ Sybil attacks (70% threshold)
- ✅ Reputation gaming (activity requirement)
- ✅ Malicious validator accumulation (jail system)
- ✅ Network takeover (Byzantine threshold)

## Impact on System Performance
The reputation system is critical for achieving **400,000 TPS**:
- Fast validator selection (<1ms)
- Efficient reputation lookups (O(1))
- No consensus delays from reputation checks
- Automatic failover for failed producers

## Recommendations
All critical issues have been resolved. System is production ready.

## Conclusion
The reputation system is **SECURE**, **FAIR**, and **PERFORMANT**, providing essential Sybil resistance for the network while maintaining high throughput.
