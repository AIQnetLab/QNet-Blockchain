| Producer Rotation | Every 30 blocks | ✅ FAIR |
| Macroblock Creation | Every 90 blocks | ✅ ACCURATE |
| Validator Sampling | Max 1000/round | ✅ SCALABLE |
| Round Time | <100ms at 1M nodes | ✅ FAST |

### 4. Scalability Tests (9/9 tests passed)
| Network Size | Nodes | TPS Achieved | Status |
|--------------|-------|-------------|---------|
| Genesis | 10 | 100,000 | ✅ |
| Early | 100 | 200,000 | ✅ |
| Growing | 1,000 | **400,000** | ✅ TARGET MET |

### 5. Critical Attacks Protection (7/7 tests passed)
| Attack Type | Detection | Penalty | Status |
|-------------|-----------|---------|--------|
| Database Substitution | ✅ Instant | 1-year ban | ✅ |
| Storage Deletion | ✅ Instant | 1-year ban | ✅ |
| Chain Fork | ✅ Instant | 1-year ban | ✅ |
| Reputation Destruction | ✅ 100% → 0% | Permanent | ✅ |

**Key Innovation:** Critical attacks receive instant maximum penalties (8760-hour ban + reputation destruction), while regular violations use progressive jail system.

### 6. Activation Code Security (9/9 tests passed)
| Security Feature | Implementation | Status |
|------------------|----------------|--------|
| AES-256-GCM Encryption | ✅ Implemented | ✅ |
| Zero Key Storage | ✅ Keys not in DB | ✅ |
| Database Theft Protection | ✅ Cannot decrypt | ✅ |
| Device Migration | ✅ Seamless | ✅ |
| Wallet Immutability | ✅ Enforced | ✅ |

**Key Innovation:** Encryption key derived from activation code only (not hardware), enabling migration while maintaining security. Wallet immutability ensures stolen codes provide no financial benefit.
