QNet Wallet - Quantum-Resistant Cryptocurrency Wallet

QNet Wallet is a secure, non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet designed for the quantum-resistant QNet blockchain. Store, send, and receive digital assets with military-grade encryption while participating in network validation as a light node operator.

KEY FEATURES:

• Secure Cryptocurrency Wallet
Non-custodial wallet with full control of your private keys. Generate and restore wallets using industry-standard BIP39 seed phrases. Your keys never leave your device.

• Send & Receive Crypto
Instantly send and receive QNet tokens and other supported cryptocurrencies. QR code scanning for easy transactions. Full transaction history and balance tracking.

• Network Validation Node
Run a light validator node to participate in the Proof of Participation (PoP) consensus mechanism. Support network security and decentralization. NOT cryptocurrency mining - only lightweight periodic status checks every 4 hours. Validator activity is recorded on-chain.

• Quantum-Resistant Security
Built with future-proof cryptography using CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium algorithms to protect against quantum computing threats.

• Multi-Language Support
Available in 11 languages: English, Chinese (Simplified), Russian, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Arabic, and Italian.

TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS:

• Quantum-Resistant Security
Implements CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium algorithms for future-proof security against quantum computing threats.

• Energy Efficient
Optimized for mobile devices with minimal battery usage. Optional validator node activation without mining or intensive computations.

• Decentralized & Non-Custodial
You control your private keys. Direct blockchain interaction without intermediaries. Open-source and transparent.

• Cross-Platform Compatibility
Seamlessly sync with QNet Wallet browser extension. Import and export wallets between devices using seed phrases.

HOW IT WORKS:

1. Create a new wallet or import existing one
2. Secure your seed phrase backup
3. Send, receive, and manage your crypto assets
4. Optional: Run a validator node to support the network

QNet Wallet provides all the functionality of a modern cryptocurrency wallet with optional validator node features. Similar to popular wallets like MetaMask or Trust Wallet, but with quantum-resistant security and the ability to run a light validation node.

IMPORTANT NOTES:

• Your private keys are never shared or stored on our servers
• Optional validator node for network participation (Proof of Participation consensus)
• NOT cryptocurrency mining - lightweight network validation only
• Validator nodes must respond to periodic network health checks
• All validator activity is recorded on the public blockchain
• Compatible with blockchain standards

ABOUT VALIDATOR NODES:
This app allows you to run a light validator node using Proof of Participation (PoP) - a lightweight consensus mechanism. Your device responds to periodic network health checks (every 4 hours) to maintain validator status. Minimal battery usage (<0.01% daily). This is NOT mining and does not involve intensive computations. Validator activity and metrics are recorded on the public blockchain. Network protocol automatically manages validator participation based on on-chain activity.

Join users securing their digital assets with quantum-resistant technology and supporting decentralized network infrastructure.
