## Features

- **Post-quantum cryptography** using Dilithium and other NIST-approved algorithms (experimental implementation)
- **Hybrid Python/Rust architecture** for balance between development speed and performance
- **Optimized data storage** with both in-memory and RocksDB options
- **Commit-reveal consensus mechanism** with protection against Sybil attacks (experimental)
- **Lightweight client support** for mobile devices (SPV) - experimental mobile optimization
- **Performance**: 424,411 TPS blockchain + 8,859 TPS mobile achieved in experimental testing (June 2025)

## Repository Structure

- `src/core/`: Main blockchain logic (experimental implementation)
- `src/consensus/`: Consensus mechanisms (experimental algorithms)
- `src/crypto/`: Cryptographic primitives (post-quantum experimental)
- `src/storage/`: Storage systems (optimized for research)
- `tests/`: Test suite (31/31 crypto tests passed)
- `docs/`: Documentation (comprehensive research documentation)

## Development

This project is part of an experimental blockchain research project using AI-assisted development with human oversight. 

### **Development Risks**
- **AI-Assisted Code**: May contain unforeseen bugs or security vulnerabilities
- **Experimental Features**: Many features are experimental and may not work as intended
- **Breaking Changes**: Updates may introduce breaking changes or require complete resets
- **Research Focus**: Designed for research and experimentation, not production use

### **Technical Limitations**
- Experimental cryptographic implementations may have unknown vulnerabilities
- Consensus mechanisms are under active testing and may fail
- Performance metrics are from controlled experimental conditions
- Network effects depend on research participation
